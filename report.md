## About This Estimator

This application allows you to estimate the quality score of white wine (ranging from 0 to 10) based on its physiochemical properties.

The prediction is based on various regression models fitted to the **UCI White Wine Quality Dataset**.

<summary> ⬇️ What is simple linear regression?</summary>
Simple linear regression is the process of looking at how a single variable affects the predicted variable. For this application, we’ll be predicting the quality variable, so we’ll let the user examine how a single variable can change the estimated predicted value of the quality. Users can input a value for x (the variable we’ll be examining) and then based on the model, predict what the wine quality will be scored based on past data for the x value from the data set. This is found with the linear regression line we’ve fitted (colored red on the plot), where the residual is how far the estimate is off of the line (otherwise, how far off the model is from the estimate.)

Multiple linear regression is the process of looking at how multiple variables affect the predicted variable. For this application, we’ll be predicting the quality variable, so we’ll let the user examine how multiple variables can change the estimated predicted value of the quality.  Users can input values for x (the variables we’ll be examining) and then based on the model, predict what the wine quality will be scored based on past data for the x values from the data set. This is found with the multiple linear regression line we’ve fitted (colored red on the plot), where the residual is how far the estimate is off of the line (otherwise, how far off the model is from the estimate.)

<summary> ⬇️ What data was collected?</summary>
The wine used is the white wine of vinho verde, which is from the northwest region of Minho, Portugal. The original data set includes both red and white whites, but this application uses exclusively white as the author only likes white wine and red white stains one’s teeth. The physicochemical data included per wine type includes the following:

- Fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm^3^ )
- Volatile acidity (g(acetic acid)/dm^3^ )
- Citric acid (g/dm^3^ )
- Residual sugar (g/dm^3^ )
- Chlorides (g(sodium chloride)/dm^3^ )
- Free sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^ )
- Total sulfur dioxide (mg/dm^3^ )
- Density (g/cm^3^ )
- pH
- Sulphates (g(potassium sulphate)/dm^3^ )
- Alcohol (vol.%)
- Quality (scale of 0-10)

<summary> ⬇️ Why this topic is interesting?</summary>
This topic was interesting to me since I drink wine myself and although I am no wine connoisseur, the science behind what makes one bottle better than another is always something I found interesting. If a vineyard is able to understand what to focus on for the greatest impact on their wine quality, there’s a business need here solved for instead of a guess and check methodology. Grape harvesting is a long science that takes a whole growth cycle to see if it yields results, which costs time, energy, and money, so if there’s a way to be methodical and scientific about it, it’s worth pursuing (and already has been!)
